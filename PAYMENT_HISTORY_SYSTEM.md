# Complete Payment History System

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive payment history system that displays rent and electricity payment details in a unified, easy-to-read table format for both administrators and renters.

## Key Features

### 1. **Combined Payment History Table**

- **Date Column**: Month/Year display with clear formatting
- **Rent Status**: Shows rent amount, payment status, and due dates
- **Electricity Usage**: Displays meter readings and units consumed
- **Units Paid Status**: Shows exactly how many units have been paid vs remaining
- **Bill Amount**: Total electricity bill with rate breakdown
- **Payment Status**: Clear indicators for paid, partial, or unpaid status
- **Outstanding**: Summary of any pending amounts

### 2. **Visual Payment Tracking**

- **Progress Bars**: Show percentage of units paid vs consumed
- **Color-coded Badges**: Green (paid), Yellow (partial), Red (unpaid)
- **Outstanding Alerts**: Clear highlighting of pending payments
- **Summary Cards**: Quick overview of totals and percentages

### 3. **Comprehensive Data Display**

For each month/year period, users can see:

- **Rent**: Amount due, payment status, payment date
- **Electricity**: Units consumed, units paid, remaining units
- **Bill Details**: Total amount, rate per unit, fixed charges
- **Payment Progress**: Visual indicators of payment completion
- **Outstanding Amounts**: Clear display of what's still owed

## New Routes Added

### Admin Routes

- **`/admin/payment_history`**: Complete payment history for all renters
- Shows aggregated data across all renters with individual breakdowns

### Renter Routes

- **`/renter/payment_history`**: Personal payment history for logged-in renter
- Shows only their own payment records and totals

## Template Features

### Admin Payment History (`admin_payment_history.html`)

- **Per-Renter Cards**: Each renter has their own section
- **Summary Statistics**: Total amounts due, paid, and outstanding
- **Detailed Table**: All payment records with full details
- **Action Buttons**: Direct links to edit rent and electricity payments
- **Outstanding Alerts**: Clear warnings for unpaid amounts

### Renter Payment History (`renter_payment_history.html`)

- **Personal Summary**: Overview cards showing payment status
- **Complete History**: All their rent and electricity records
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual indicators of payment completion
- **Outstanding Alerts**: Clear display of any pending payments

## Data Structure

Each record shows:

```
Date (Month/Year) | Rent Status | Electricity Usage | Units Paid Status | Bill Amount | Payment Status | Outstanding
```

### Example Row:

- **Date**: January 2025
- **Rent Status**: ₹5,000 - Paid (15 Jan)
- **Electricity Usage**: 150 units (Previous: 1000, Current: 1150)
- **Units Paid Status**: 120 units paid, 30 units remaining (80% progress bar)
- **Bill Amount**: ₹750 (₹5.00/unit + ₹100 fixed)
- **Payment Status**: Partial - ₹600 paid
- **Outstanding**: Electric: ₹150

## Navigation Integration
